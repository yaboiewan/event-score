*IDEA 135: Games at Work*
# Sketch 1: Event Score (3 Variations)

## Rules
Each variation should be displayed on a separate page of a three-page PDF (or three clearly labeled
one-page PDFs) and as a three-page printout on paper.

Title your score. Use the same title for all variations.

1. On one page, write/type your "event score." This score should be a set of simple instructions for a
non-winnable, voluntary, interactive, playable experience in time. Use a minimum of one word and a
maximum of 25 words.
2. On a second page, create a hand-illustrated picture of your score. Your picture can be an illustration
of what the experience would look like if people actually performed your event score in real life.
Alternatively, it can be an abstraction or visualization (e.g. diagram or symbolic notation) of your
score. Scan or photograph this hand-drawn picture.
3. On a third page, reprint/retype your event score (variation 1) with a couple of adjustments. If your
original score was not written in complete sentences, force your words into complete sentences
(prose-ify your score). You must also add one new sentence that describes a "win condition" (ending
point) for your playable experience. The win condition does not need to be perfectly rational or
realistic.

## Learning Objectives
1. Try out a creative strategy for developing an unusual play experience
2. Think about the way rules and instructions impact a player’s experience
3. Consider the mechanics of interactive experience
4. Get your freak on

## Notes
1. Your score can be performable/playable in real life, but it does not need to be. For the purposes of
this assignment, the events will only take place in the reader's imagination. The important thing is
to create a potent mental impression of a playable experience.
2. If you’re stumped about what to write, browse the Fluxus Performance Notebook and try to locate
event scores that spark your imagination or leave a vivid impression in your mind. Attempt to mimic
the tone or writing style of the scores that interest you. If you’re still stumped, try using one of the
"automatic" Surrealist word games to generate unpredictable content.
